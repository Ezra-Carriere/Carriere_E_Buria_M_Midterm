        <h2>Overwatch is a superior game to Valorant</h2>
        <p>Overwatch was released by Blizzard in 2016. Since then the game has gone through countless patches and changes to make it as fun and fair as possible. The most recent of those changes being a massive overhaul to the game in which they called even changed the name to Overwatch 2. This change has been extremely well recieved from the community and has made the game relevant again. With the recent boost in popularity, the game is being compared to Valorant as to which game is better. In my opinion there is no doubt that Overwatch is superior.</p>
        <p>To start, Overwatch has nearly double the amount of unique playable characters with 35 compared to Valorant's 20. This allows players to have far more options to choose form when playing, creating more opportunities for different ways to play the game. When we look at actual gameplay, the two games have similarities, but are overall very different. Overwatch is far more fast paced with each game being a continuos round with respawns opposed to Valorant's round system where there are no respawns. The fast paced gameplay requires you to always be engaged and active with no down time causing less dull moments.</p>
